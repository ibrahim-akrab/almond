A new JavaScript general purpose parser. Coconut aims to generate ESTree compatible abstract syntax trees. Coconut uses [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) for parsing.

This project currently is very work in progress. It can parse `jQuery` but still fails for `react` and `angular`.
Currently, only ES5 spec is implemented. ES6 and beyond are being worked on.
